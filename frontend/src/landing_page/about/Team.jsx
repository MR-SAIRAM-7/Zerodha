                        SaiRam is currently building a full-fledged stock trading platform inspired by
                        Zerodha, using the MERN stack. His goal is to create a modern, seamless, and
                        intuitive investing experience for users, while also learning and mastering
                        real-world software engineering practices.

                        With a passion for full-stack development, he is designing and coding the
                        entire platform from scratch â€” from the landing pages and signup flows to
                        backend APIs, authentication, and trading features.

                        Outside of coding, he is deeply curious about finance and technology, and
                        enjoys experimenting with UI/UX ideas to deliver clean, simple, and scalable
                        user experiences.
